  0.25 degree ACCESS-OM2 global model configuration under interannual
  forcing. ACCESS-OM2-025 physics-only contribution to the CMIP6 Ocean
  Model Intercomparison Program project phase 2 (OMIP-2), as discussed
  by Tsujino et al. (2020, GMD,
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2019-363). The configuration is based on
  that described in Kiss et al. (2020),
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-401-2020, but with many improvements.
  Initial conditions are WOA13v2 potential temperature and practical
  salinity. However, the WOA potential temperature field is converted
  to Conservative Temperature for the initical condition unlike
  earlier versions of ACCESS-OM2. The topography has also been updated
  (see https://github.com/COSIMA/access-om2/issues/158). Run with
  JRA55-do v1.4.0 interannually-varying forcing with all solid runoff
  converted to liquid runoff with no heat transfer. The OMIP-2
  protocol consists of six consecutive cycles of the 61-year period
  starting on 1 Jan 1958 and finishing on 1 Jan 2019. To avoid issues
  with leap years and calendars, each cycle is run as a separate
  "ensemble" experiment - and thus each has the same time/calendar
  vector. The configuration files used for this simulation are on
  github in the repository
  https://github.com/rmholmes/025deg_jra55_iaf. Each cycle is under a
  different branch listed as omip_amoctopo_cycle[1-6].
note: >-
  Output diagnostics are extensive based on the CMIP6 OMIP diagnostics
  request listed in Griffies et al (2016,
  https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-3231-2016), including many budget
  diagnostics.
